# JobScraper
Python web scraping job information from indeed.

Utilizing the Beautiful Soup and Pandas libraries we can easily scrape job information
for any job on indeed by parsing and searching through the html data.

After parsing and searching the data, we put the information into a dictionary 
and use this dictionary alongside pandas to transfer this data into a CSV.

Thus, creating a python bot that automatically pulls any job data from Indeed within ~3-4 seconds on average.
